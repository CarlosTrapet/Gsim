<p>Nightbugs wriggle and glow when exposed to the milk of your breasts. Gather nightbugs near your breasts to store additional milk.</p>
<p>Your nightbugs store up to {{unit.effect[0].calcStats().capMult | percent:{places:2, plusOne:true} }} more maximum milk. Attracting more has diminishing returns, but can increase this to a maximum of {{unit.effect[0].val | percent:{plusOne:true} }}.</p>
